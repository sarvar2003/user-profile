# User Profile Project

Welcome to the User Profile Project! This repository demonstrates how to manage user profiles using Django, a high-level Python web framework.

## Features

- **Django Back-End**: A robust back-end built with Django to handle user profile management.
- **User Authentication**: Includes login, registration, and user profile functionalities.
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete user profiles.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project locally, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Django 3.2+](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sarvar2003/user-profile.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd user-profile
   ```

3. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate   # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. **Install the project dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Apply the database migrations:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **Create a superuser for accessing the Django admin interface:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Django development server:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

2. **Open your browser and go to:**
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

   You will see the home page of the user profile application. You can access the Django admin interface at `http://localhost:8000/admin` using the superuser credentials created earlier.
